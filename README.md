## The Sound Fourier Transform

*A fun project: Using Fourier Transforms to understand why different humans "hear" the same sound clip differently.*

In this repo I explore  how  Fourier  transform  can  help  us understand human sounds.  Two years ago, the Laurel/Yanny audio clip ignited the internet.  Some people  hear  the  clip  play  as  “Laurel”  and  some  hear  it  as  “Yanny”. Several  news  outlets  posted explanations of the different perceptions, and made tools that let you perceive both interpretations. Data file included in the repo.
